Playing with AI.  Maybe a game will emerge.

Things to try:

- Model a guy choosing how to get to work (train, bike, walk) [trainstation.py](trainstation.py)
- Bar fight 
- Shooter learns how to shoot inaccurate gun.
- Find the murderer (social knowledge-sharing).
- People share what they know to achieve some common goal.
- Planning ahead without knowing the end (probabilities).
- Deciding what to make to bring to the market to sell (learn over time).
